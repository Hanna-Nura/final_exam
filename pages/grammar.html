          <h5 class="h5-title">Simple/Indefinite Tenses</h5>
          <p class="par-gap">
            The Simple Present tense or Present Tense is one of the most basic
            tenses in English. It is used to talk about something that is
            habitually performed, or a state that generally or currently exists.
            Auxilary verbs for this tense depend on the type of the sentence:
            DO/DOES with verbs and AM/IS/ARE without.
          </p>
          <p class="par-gap">
            The Past Simple is used to describe an activity or an event that
            happened in the past or a past state of being, usually used with a
            time marker, like yesterday or last week/months, etc. Formed:
            regular verbs V+ED and irregular verbs V2 (second form); the
            auxilary verb is DID.
          </p>
          <p class="par-gap">
            The Future Simple is a verb tense used to describe an event or
            action that has not yet happened and is expected to happen in the
            future. Structural formula: WILL + verb. Old textbooks state
            'shall', but at the moment it's not so widely used anymore.
          </p>
          <div class="item-button">
            <a href="../pages/test.html" class="button test-btn" type="button"

            >
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="item2">
          <h5 class="h5-title">Continuous Tenses</h5>
          <p class="par-gap">
            The Present Continuous tense is used to talk about the ongoing
            actions, events, or conditions that are still not finished. It could
            be from short action to long action. The structure is AM/IS/ARE +
            Ving.
          </p>
          <p class="par-gap">
            The Past Continuous tense is used to describe events or actions that
            were happening in the past during a specific period of time. Usually
            this tense is used with a marker like 'from 5 to 6', 'the whole
            evening yesterday', at 5pm, etc. The structure of the tense is
            WAS/WERE + Ving.
          </p>
          <p class="par-gap">
            The Future Continuous tense is used to describe an ongoing action
            that will occur in the future. It's not as widely used as the
            present and past tenses of this group, often used as a prediction or
            something a person will be doing in the future at a certain moment.
            Formed: WILL BE + Ving.
          </p>

          <h5 class="h5-title">Perfect Tenses</h5>
          <p class="par-gap">
            The Present Perfect tense is used to describe a situation or event
            that has already occurred, but connected to present. It can be used
            to describe experiences, and situations that occurred in the past
            but still have an influence on the present. It's not used with time
            markers. Formed: HAVE/HAS + V3/ed.
          </p>
          <p class="par-gap">
            The Past Perfect tense is used to describe an event that occurred
            before a completed action in the past. In other words, it's used
            mostly in combnation with Past Simple tense and rarely used by
            itself, only with the marker BY. Formed: HAD + V3/ed
          </p>
          <p class="par-gap">
            The Future Perfect is used to describe an action that will be
            completed between now and a certain point in the future. Usually it
            is used with the marker BY and means that a certain action will be
            done by specific time. Formed: WILL HAVE + V3/ed.
          </p>
          <div class="item-button">
            <a href="../pages/test.html" class="button test-btn" type="button"
              >Take a test</a

        <div class="item4">
          <h5 class="h5-title">Perfect Continuous Tenses</h5>
          <p class="par-gap">
            The Present Perfect Continuous tense shows a situation that has
            started in the past and continues in the present or has recently
            finished with a specific result that you are stating in the
            sentence. This is the most used tense from this group. Formed:
            HAVE/HAS + been + Ving.
          </p>
          <p class="par-gap">
            The Past Perfect Continuous tense represents any action or event
            that started in the past and sometimes continued into another action
            or another time. Usually it's measured how long the action had been
            going, so you will see markers: for/since. Formed: HAD + been +
            Ving.
          </p>
          <p class="par-gap">
            The Future Perfect Continuous focuses on the duration of an action
            before a specific time in the future. It's rather rare, because
            usually it means some measured continuous action in the future, as a
            rule by a specific time. Formed: WILL + HAVE been + Ving
          </p>
          <div class="item-button">
            <a href="../pages/test.html" class="button test-btn" type="button"

        <div class="item5">
          <h5 class="h5-title">Future-in-the-Part</h5>
          <p class="par-gap">
            All the tenses in this groupd are the same as future forms, but you
            need to use WOULD instead of WILL in this case. But, this tense is
            always combined with some Past Simple tense, sort of to indication
            that while in the past, the sentence is actually talking about the
            future.
          </p>
          <p class="par-gap">
            This tenses are used in Sequence of Tenses rules, when all the
            tenses have to change when Past Simple is used in the context. But
            if you think about this tenses, you will see that it's logical to
            use them, since usual future will not be suitable in this case.

        <div class="item6">
          <h5 class="h5-title">Sequence of Tenses</h5>
          <p class="par-gap">
            The Sequence of Tenses is the rules that regulate the use of tenses.
            There are a few rules to remember to use these tenses correctly and
            meaningfully. While some may seem self-evident, others must be
            addressed. It's importnat to learn about the sequence of tenses,
            their rules, and some typical examples.
          </p>
          <p class="par-gap">
            The basic principle of the sequence of tenses is to actually change
            all the tenses in thei groups from present to past, and to change
            will to would. In the same time Past Simple will change to Past
            Perfect.
